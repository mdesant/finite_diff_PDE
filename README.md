# finite_diff_PDE
Implementation of PDE solver using finite difference method for two electrons in an infinite square well

test directory:
 FD_wfn.ipynb : a jupyter notebook 
    margin = 4.0; set grid dimension in atomic unit (bohr)
    npoint = 20 ; number of points along each axis ( x_1 and x_2) so that a (npoint x npoint) grid is formed out of them
    get_state = 4; the wavefunction to be plotted

requirements:
 numpy
 scipy
 matplotlib
